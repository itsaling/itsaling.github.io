My Web Portfolio
As you can already tell, its Aling is a website that I both designed and developed to showcase my portfolio and skill set as a front-end web developer.

# Vision
Designing the look of the website was the first part and the most challenging part because I wanted the website to reflect my personality while maintaining a clean and modern style. I’ve spent a lot of time creating different versions of the site and experiment with different color schemes as well as look for inspiration in sites like Awwwards, dribble, and Pinterest. Eventually, I landed on this current design to which I feel channels my style and personality.


# Design Processes
I utilized Adobe XD to wireframe, design, and prototype the web site before actually developing the HTML structure because it’s much easier to have a vision and layout before spending time developing it blindly. To build the site I took advantage of libraries such as jquery, and anime.js to add simple animations to the site to make it more interesting to the eyes.


# Program Used 
HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Anime.js
