My Web Portfolio
As you can already tell, its Aling is a website that I both designed and developed to showcase my portfolio and skill set as a front-end web developer.

# Vision
Designing the website initally was the most challenging part because I wanted the website to reflect my personality while maintaining a clean and modern style. I’ve spent a lot of time creating different versions of the site, I've experimented with different color schemes, and I've searched for inspiration on sites like Awwwards, dribble, and Pinterest. Eventually, I landed on this current design to which I feel channels my style and personality.


# Design Processes
I utilized Adobe XD to wireframe, design, and prototype the web site before actually developing the HTML structure because it’s much easier to have a vision and layout before spending time developing it blindly. To build the site I took advantage of libraries such as jquery, and anime.js to add simple animations to add visual appeal.


# Program Used
